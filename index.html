        // when creating a function in javaScript - use the keyword function to let the interpereted know that you are creating a reusable chunk of code
        // we create a descriptive name for what our function will do - most of the time our function names should include a verb; start function names with a letter, you can use numbers and _ 
        // we have camelCase or snake_case for naming stayles - use whichever one you want, but stay consistant
        // after the function name, use parenthesis () whether or not you are passing values into the funtion
        // the function code must be places within curly braces {}
        function addNumbers(){
            // create 2 variables so we can add them together
            let number1 = 5; // we are hard-coding the value of 5 here
            var number2 = 8;

            // create another variable to hold the sum
            let sum = number1 + number2;
            // to concantenate (add text together), you can use + or ,
            console.log("The sum of your numbers is:", sum);

        // this line of code calls the function so we can test it
        addNumbers();

        <h3>Decicion Logic (if/else)</h3>
        <script>
            // when testing an if statement, make sure to use == (equality) instead of = (assignment: this will change the value of your variable, which you probably don't want)
            // in an if chunk of code you will have 1 and only 1 if statement, you can have as many else if as needed, and optionally 1 else statement
            // && is and - both conditions must evaluate to true
            // || is or - only 1 condition muct evaluate to true
